# Portfolio

## Project Description

The goal of this Portfolio is to showcase the projects that highlight my proficiency as a web developer/ software engineer. This page is an interactive and adaptive snapshot of that contains both impressive code and links to live projects I've worked on in the past. 

## User Story

AS A developer
I WANT to showcase my proficiencies though an interactive page that can be viewed by employers
SO THAT they will consider me a valuable candiate for open positions

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
